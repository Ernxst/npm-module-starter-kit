# TypeScript NPM Module Starter Kit

This is a [clonable monorepo template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for authoring an `npm` module with TypeScript. Out of the box, it:

* Provides minimally-viable `tsconfig.json` settings
* Scaffolds a silly arithmetic module (`src/index.ts`)
* Scaffolds test suites for full test coverage (`src/__tests__`)
* Generates source maps
* Generates type definitions
* Generates multiple distribution formats:
  * ES Module (`dist/index.js`)
  * CommonJS (`dist/index.cjs`)
  * IIFE (`dist/index.global.js`)
* Scaffolds a GitHub Action for Continuous Integration (CI) that:
  * lints codebase
  * type checks codebase
  * checks if compilation is successful
  * runs the test suite(s)
  * reports test coverage
* Scaffolds a GitHub Action for automatic changelog releasing

All configuration is accessible via the `tsup.config.ts`.

## Features

* 🛠 Code formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
  * Formatting on `git push` with [Nano-staged](https://github.com/usmanyunusov/nano-staged)
* 🔎 Type safety with [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)
* 📄 GitHub guidelines and templates:
  * Issues
  * Commit conventions
  * Code of conduct
  * Contributing
  * Pull requests

## Setup

1. [Clone this template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
2. Replace all instances of `TODO` within the `license` and `package.json` files
3. Create [CodeCov](https://codecov.io) account (free for OSS)
4. Copy the provided CodeCov token as the `CODECOV_TOKEN` [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) (for CI reporting)
5. Replace `src/index.ts` with your own code! 🎉

## Commands

### build

Builds your modules for distribution in multiple formats (ESM, CommonJS, and IIFE).

```sh
pnpm run build
```

### test

Runs your test suite(s) (`/tests/**`, `/__tests__/**`) against your source code (`/src/**`).<br>Doing so allows for accurate code coverage.

```sh
pnpm test
```

## Publishing

> **Important:** Please finish [Setup](#setup) before continuing!

Once all `TODO` notes have been updated & your new module is ready to be shared, all that's left to do is decide its new version &mdash; AKA, do the changes constitute a `patch`, `minor`, or `major` release?

Once decided, you can run the following:

```sh
pnpm changeset
```

And then answer the prompted questions.

When you next push your changes to the remote repository, a changeset will automatically
be generated in a new pull request. Once you merge this pull request, a new release will
be visible in th repo.

## 💡 Contributing

To get started with development, you will need an editor (VS Code is recommended), a browser that runs JavaScript and some extra prerequisites:

* [Node.js (>= 14)](https://nodejs.org)
* [pnpm 7.5.2](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack)

To get started with contributing to this project, first fork this git repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ernxst/galaxia-next.git
```
